# battery_daq
Battery powered DAQ. Arduino Mega 2560 based data acquisition with csv output saved to SD card and broadcast over Bluetooth. Records 2 voltage, 1 current and 13 thermistor readings. 
Capable of sending battery power to apply load at arbitrary duty cycle.

See Arduino Thermistor based DAQ pdf for information on how this works and how to use it.

There are lazy fixes in the code. Do not use this for any reason other than learning!!
